    // The Math.pow(..., 1.5) part introduces a decay function, where the post's "hotness" decays faster as it ages (with the exponent 1.5). This means that older posts lose their popularity score more quickly, making newer posts more relevant in terms of popularity.

// Hot Score = (upvotes - downvotes) / (post_age_in_seconds + 2)^s
//  Reddit-style systems to determine how "hot" a post is, and it's typically based on a combination of upvotes, post age, and sometimes comment count. 
// will focus on the positive votes and the recency of the post.
// Hot Score = upvotes / (post_age_in_seconds + 2)^s


// Wilson Score = (p + z^2 / (2n) - z * sqrt((p * (1 - p) + z^2 / (4n)) / n)) / (1 + z^2 / n)
// calculate the confidence of a vote proportion (like the percentage of upvotes in a post). It's often used in rating or voting systems to take into account both the number of votes and the proportion of positive votes. 
// Wilson Score = p
// p is the proportion of upvotes (upvotes / upvotes) â€” effectively, it will always be 1 if we only have upvotes.

// Hot Score:

// We're no longer subtracting downvotes, so the Hot Score now just considers the number of upvotes divided by the age of the post (with the +2 in the denominator to avoid division by zero).
// The factor 1.5 in the decay function controls how fast posts lose their score with age. You can adjust this factor as needed to control the "decay" of older posts.
// Wilson Score:

// Since we have no downvotes, the Wilson Score will always be 1 when there are upvotes. This might seem redundant, but we keep it here to preserve the structure in case you want to add more complexity later.
// If you wanted a more meaningful Wilson Score for posts with a small number of upvotes, you could add logic to calculate it based on the proportion of upvotes to total possible votes or something similar.
// Recency:

// The recency score still applies and decays for older posts. We give newer posts a higher score.
// Final Score:

// The final score is a combination of the Hot Score, Wilson Score (always 1), comment count, and recency score. You can adjust the weights (upvoteWeight, commentWeight, and recencyWeight) based on how important you want each factor to be in the final score.
